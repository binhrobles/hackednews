## Hacked News

[hn.binhrobles.com](hn.binhrobles.com)

Just another Hacker News remix, for learning. Wanted to see historically popular posts. Without paying for some SQL DB, historical aggregation queries would've been pretty hard / expensive, so just went with a simple month picker vs current feed.

Tech used:

- [Remix](remix.run)
- [Tailwind w/ DaisyUI](daisyui.com)
- [SST](sst.dev) for local dev + deployment
- [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) for live data
- [hckrnews.com](hckrnews.com) endpoints for pulling historical data
